class AdaptiveLearningRate(object):
	'''Class for managing an adaptive learning rate schedule based on the
	recent history of loss values. The adaptive schedule begins with an
	optional warm-up period, during which the learning rate logarithmically
	increases up to the initial rate. For the remainder of the training
	procedure, the learning rate will increase following a period of monotonic
	improvements in the loss and will decrease if a loss is encountered that
	is worse than all losses in the recent period. Hyperparameters control the
	length of each of these periods and the extent of each type of learning
	rate change.

	Note that this control flow is asymmetric--stricter criteria must be met
	for increases than for decreases in the learning rate This choice 1)
	encourages decreases in the learning rate when moving into regimes with a
	flat loss surface, and 2) attempts to avoid instabilities that can arise
	when the learning rate is too high (and the often irreversible
	pathological parameter updates that can result). Practically,
	hyperparameters may need to be tuned to optimize the learning schedule and
	to ensure that the learning rate does not explode.

	See test(...) to simulate learning rate trajectories based on specified
	hyperparameters.

	The standard usage is as follows:

	# Set hyperparameters as desired.
	alr_hps = dict()
	alr_hps['initial_rate'] = 1.0
	alr_hps['n_warmup_steps'] = 0
	alr_hps['warmup_scale'] = 0.001
	alr_hps['do_decrease_rate'] = True
	alr_hps['min_steps_per_decrease'] = 5
	alr_hps['decrease_factor'] = 0.95
	alr_hps['do_increase_rate'] = True
	alr_hps['min_steps_per_increase'] = 5
	alr_hps['increase_factor'] = 1./0.95
	alr_hps['verbose'] = False
	alr = AdaptiveLearningRate(**alr_hps)

	while some_conditions(...):
		# This loop defines one step of the training procedure.

		# Get the current learning rate
		learning_rate = alr()

		# Use the current learning rate to update the model parameters.
		# Get the loss of the model after the update.
		params, loss = run_one_training_step(params, learning_rate, ...)

		# Update the learning rate based on the most recent loss value
		# and an internally managed history of loss values.
		alr.update(loss)

		# (Optional): Occasionally save model checkpoints along with the
		# AdaptiveLearningRate object (for seamless restoration of a training
		# session)
		if some_other_conditions(...):
			save_checkpoint(params, ...)

		Args:
			A set of optional keyword arguments for overriding the default values of the following hyperparameters:

			initial_rate: A non-negative float specifying the initial learning
			rate. Default: 1.0.

			n_warmup_steps: A non-negative int specifying the number of warm-up
			steps to take. During these warm-up steps, the learning rate will
			logarithmically increase up to initial_rate. Default: 0 (i.e., no
			warm-up).

			warmup_scale: A float between 0 and 1 specifying the learning rate
			on the first warm-up step, relative to initial_rate. The first
			warm-up learning rate is warmup_scale * initial_rate. Default:
			0.001.

			do_decrease_rate: A bool indicating whether or not to decrease the
			learning rate during training (after any warm-up). Default: True.

			min_steps_per_decrease: A non-negative int specifying the number
			of recent steps' loss values to consider when deciding whether to
			decrease the learning rate. Learning rate decreases are made when
			a loss value is encountered that is worse than every loss value in
			this window. When the learning rate is decreased, no further
			decreases are considered until this many new steps have
			transpired. Larger values will slow convergence due to the
			learning rate. Default 5.

			decrease_factor: A float between 0 and 1 specifying the extent of
			learning rate decreases. Whenever a decrease is made, the learning
			rate decreases from x to decrease_factor * x. Values closer to 1
			will slow convergence due to the learning rate. Default: 0.95.

			do_increase_rate: A bool indicating whether or not to increase the
			learning rate during training (after any warm-up). Default: True.

			min_steps_per_increase: A non-negative int specifying the number
			of recent steps' loss values to consider when deciding whether to
			increase the learning rate. Learning rate increases are made when
			the loss has monotonically increased over this many steps. When
			the learning rate is increased, no further increases are
			considered until this many new steps have transpired. Default 5.

			increase_factor: A float greater than 1 specifying the extent of
			learning rate increases. Whenever an increase is made, the
			learning rate increases from x to increase_factor * x. Larger
			values will slow convergence due to the learning rate. Default:
			1./0.95.

			verbose: A bool indicating whether or not to print status updates.
			False.
